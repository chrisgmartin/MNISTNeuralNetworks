Image Recognition Neural Networks

## About

This was the final project of the CUNY course DATA622: Big Data and Machine Learning.
The final project involved creating a neural network to identify handwritten numbers.
As part of this project, I created two *[UPDATE]* neural networks: a nueral network utilizing stochastic gradient descent and backpropegation, as well as a convolutional neural network.

## TO DO:

I plan to update this project to include a network using Keras, and one using TensorFlow.
